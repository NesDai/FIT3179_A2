          Organ donation pledges refer to a formal commitment made by
          individuals to donate their organs after death, with the goal of
          saving or improving the lives of those in need of transplants. The
          need for organ donations has grown significantly worldwide due to
          advancements in medical procedures and the rising number of patients
          suffering from organ failure. However, despite the life-saving
          potential of organ donation, many countries, including Malaysia, face
          challenges in securing enough pledges to meet demand. Factors such as
          cultural beliefs, religious views, lack of awareness, and
          misconceptions about the organ donation process often deter
          individuals from registering as donors.
